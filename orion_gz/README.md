## 🚀 Launch files

Make sure you have followed the [installation_process](/README.md) for the GZ package and the [ORION common](https://github.com/Tesis-ORION/orion_common) repository, also you should have sourced your workspace before you continue:

### Robot State Publisher for Gazebo

Launch the robot description with the *gazebo* flag ready to mount the robot description for simulations on gz by considering the file [rsp_gz.launch.py](/orion_gz/launch/rsp_gz.launch.py). It also considers the proper replacing for using the meshes during the conversion from URDF to SDF.

~~~bash
# Basic usage:
# ros2 launch orion_gz rsp_gz.launch.py
# Additional arguments:
#   camera : Can be 'astra_s', 'a010' or 'os30a'.
#   gazebo : Boolean (true/false) to indicate the usage of gazebo tags.
#   g_mov : Boolean (true/false) to use g_mov module when using 'a010' depth cam.
#   rasp : Whether to use 'rpi4' or 'rpi5', this will imply a change in the sound hardware.
#   ros_bridge : Boolean (true/false) to indicate the usage of the bridge for the clock
#   servo : Boolean (true/false) to indicate if use servo arms
#   simplified : Whether to use or not a simplified version of the URDF with less elements.   
ros2 launch orion_gz rsp_gz.launch.py camera:=a010
~~~

The reason why there are two **robot_state_publishers** is due to the specific management of meshes in GZ, as it is required to provide the file path, making it dependable on a fixed path, so this may lead to the meshes not working if you are using another machine. Therefore, the two options of robot state publisher were separated, one is present in **orion_description** and the other one is present here.

### Spawn robot

Spawn the robot in a given world of the simulator GZ Sim by considering the [spawn_robot.launch.py](/orion_gz/launch/spawn_robot.launch.py) file, which also loads the configurations from the **orion_description** package.

### Gazebo launch with ros2_control

Spawn the robot and includes the configuration of bridges for sensors while also connecting the actuators (servos and motors) with the proper ros2_control interface in order to interact with them. It considers a differential driver controller for the DC motors and forward controllers for the servo motors. For more information, check the file [gz_ros2_control.launch.py](/orion_gz/launch/gz_ros2_control.launch.py)

## ⚙️ Params and configs

### a010_bridge.yaml

Contains the params to do the bridge to publish, from GZ to ROS 2, the depth image, camera info and point cloud of the A010 in simulation.

### astra_bridge.yaml

Contains the elements to make the bridge to publish, from GZ to ROS 2, the camera image, depth image, camera info and point cloud of the Astra S in simulation.

### base_bridge.yaml

Contains the element to exchange the information of the base simulation of the robot. On one hand, from ROS to GZ, the cmd_vel topic. On the other hand, from GZ to ROS, the TF tree, the odom, the joint_states and the scan of the LIDAR.

### g_mov_bridge.yaml

Presents the information to publish from ROS to GZ in the case of the G_Mov servo, and also to publish from GZ to ROS the info of the PI Cam (image and camera info) and the IMU.

### g_mov_short_bridge.yaml

Contains information to just use the Pi cam of the simulated version of the G-Mov module.

### os30a_bridge.yaml

Contains the elements to make the bridge to publish, from GZ to ROS 2, the camera image, depth image, camera info and point cloud of the OS30A in simulation.

### ros2_ctl_extra_bridge.yaml

Param bridge intended to be used when having **ros2_control** so you can access the TF tree additions coming from the controllers while also getting access to the joint states and the LIDAR scan.

### servo_bridge.yaml

Focused on the commands from ROS to GZ of the arms' servos when using native GZ plugins on the simulation.

## 🗒️ Additional comments

- By default, the **rgdb** and **depth** cameras' **point clouds** were disabled due to high overload and slow the processing of the simulation. If you want to activate them, go to the [config](/orion_gz/config/) dir, search for the .yaml file of the camera you want to use and uncomment the point cloud arg.

---

## ⚠️ Troubleshooting

### Slow simulation

This may depend on your machine resources, as ORION contains multiple plugins for sensors and actuators with a full definition model, it may run slow sometimes. In those cases, you can implement the next solutions:

- Use the simplified version of the robot, as it will ignore the meshes, links and joints of inner parts. Keep in mind that this may affect the physic simulation.

    ~~~bash
    ros2 launch gz_ros2_control.launch.py simplified:=true
    ~~~

- Delete the logs of the simulator, as this may be slowing down your system.

    ~~~bash
    sudo rm ./.gz/sim/log/*
    ~~~

- Check that GZ Sim is using your GPU card (if you have one).

- If you do not require depth image, you can comment the bridge, similar to what was suggested on the **Additional notes section**.

### Problems adding new world

Currently there are 3 supported world, if you want to explore with another one, it is recommended to clone it into the [worlds](/orion_gz/world/) directory, ensuring that the name of the file and the name of the world are the same excluding the extension, for example, if you want to add a world called *park.sdf*, then the name of the world should be *park*.

If you do not respect this convention, the GZ topics convention name for ORION will fail. You can validate this by going to the different config files of the GZ bridge in the [config](/orion_gz/config/) directory.

### ROS topic for a sensor / actuator doesn't exists

Remember that the connections between GZ and ROS 2 are possible by using bridges, there are certain definitions made. However, there are possibilities of mismatches or missing topics. In this cases, run the simulation with your preferred args, then proceed:

1. Open a terminal and list the topics:

    ~~~bash
    gz topic -l
    ~~~

2. Here we will suppose the LIDAR topic is missing on ROS2, so we drag our attention to the LIDAR gz topic:

    ~~~bash
    gz topic -l | grep scan
    # In my case is:
    # /world/custom_empty/model/orion/link/base_link/sensor/gpu_lidar/scan
    ~~~

3. Check the information about the topic:

    ~~~bash
    gz topic -i -t /world/custom_empty/model/orion/link/base_link/sensor/gpu_lidar/scan

    # It returned:
    # Publishers [Address, Message Type]:
    # tcp://172.18.0.1:36933, gz.msgs.LaserScan
    ~~~

4. Check the pair of the topic for the **ros_gz_bridge** on the official [repo](https://github.com/gazebosim/ros_gz/blob/jazzy/ros_gz_bridge/README.md)

5. Add the config to a bridge file, based on the type and purpose review the **Params and configs** sections and then try again your launch, ensuring that the parameters are valid to call the edited config file.
